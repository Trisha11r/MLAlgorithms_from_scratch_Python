# Common ML Algorithms from scratch_Python3 (Learning Repository)

This repository consists the implementations of a few common ML Algorithms from scratch in Python3. The dataset used is the famous Breast Cancer Dataset (Breast_Cancer_Data). Observations are also made on a Linearly Separable Dataset (linearly-separable-dataset) in some cases.

The algorithms implemented are:
  - Perceptron Learning Algorithm (perceptron.py)
  - Adaptive Boosting Algorithm (adaBoost.py)
  - K Means Clustering Algorithm (kmeans.py)
  - K Nearest Neighbour Classifier (knn.py)
  - Support Vector Machine Classifier (svm.py)
  
### Perceptron Learning Algorithm (perceptron.py)
Datasets: linearly-separable-dataset.csv / Breast_cancer_data.csv
Modes: erm (For ERM Loss calculation) / crossvalidtf (For Cross Validation Loss Calculation)
Run following on command line mentioning the appropriate dataset file and mode: python perceptron.py --dataset linearly-separable-dataset.csv --mode erm


### Adaptive Boosting Algorithm (adaBoost.py)
Dataset: Breast_cancer_data.csv
Modes: erm (For ERM Loss calculation) / crossvalidtf (For Cross Validation Loss Calculation)
Run following on command line mentioning the appropriate mode:
python adaBoost.py --mode erm


### K Means Clustering Algorithm (kmeans.py)


### K Nearest Neighbour Classifier (knn.py)


### Support Vector Machine Classifier (svm.py)
